# CodeReviews Directory

Use this folder to track review work for the upstream `scripting/feedland` project. Findings documented here should translate into upstream issues (filed at <https://github.com/scripting/feedlandDev/issues>) or status updates once they are validated in this testing fork.

- `reviewPlan.md` — master checklist of upcoming review tracks (security, privacy, reliability, etc.) with suggested follow-up tasks.
- `notesYYYYMMDD.md` — individual review logs. Name new files with the date of the review session so they sort chronologically (for example `notes20251030.md`).
- `security.md`, `testing.md`, `backups.md` — deep dives for specific review tracks. Add new files (e.g., `drDrill.md`) as reviews complete and link them from `reviewPlan.md`.
- `releaseChecklist.md` — repeatable pre-release validation steps (automated tests, smoke runs, performance spot-checks).
- `mustDoIssues.md` — consolidated list of blocking issues (secrets exposure, deployment gaps, sanitization) that need resolution before wider launch.

Keep filenames camelCased, add timestamps/headings per `notes/_TEMPLATE.md`, and update this index whenever you add or rename review documents.
