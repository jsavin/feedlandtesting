# FeedLand Code Review Notes

All entries here originate from testing work against `scripting/feedland`. Reference upstream commit hashes or files whenever possible so maintainers can act on the findings.

Use this file to capture review findings, cleanup candidates, and follow-up items that surface while reading code. Keep entries chronological and mirror the `worknotes.md` style so future contributors can scan quickly. See `notes/_TEMPLATE.md` for a reusable entry block.

#### 10/30/25; 11:41:44 PM by JES -- Missing getALotOLikes handler

Context:
- Topic / subsystem: feedland.js GET routing, likes feature
- Related files or endpoints: feedland.js (`GET /getalotoflikes`), database/database.js exports

Highlights:
- Finding: `feedland.js` exposes `GET /getalotoflikes`, delegating to `database.getALotOLikes`, but `database/database.js` no longer exports that function (source shows it commented out in `database/source.opml`).
- Observation: Any request to `/getalotoflikes` will throw `TypeError: database.getALotOLikes is not a function`, bubbling a 500 to clients; breaks bulk-like retrievals used by legacy UI pieces.
- Observation: Code comments indicate the helper once lived in `viewers.js`; when logic moved into `database/database.js`, the export was omitted, leaving stale API surface.

Follow-up:
- [ ] **Recommended:** retire `/getalotoflikes` in `feedland.js`, remove the dead call, and update any dependent clients; document the removal in release notes. (Owner TBD)
