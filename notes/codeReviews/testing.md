# FeedLand Testing Roadmap

This roadmap tracks test coverage we exercise inside `feedlandtesting` to inform upstream proposals for `scripting/feedland`.

#### 10/31/25; 12:00:51 AM by JES -- Establishing coverage targets

Context:
- Topic / subsystem: holistic testing strategy for FeedLand service and database layers
- Related files or endpoints: feedland.js, database/database.js, blog.js, HTTP API documented in `contributing/apiOverview.md`

Highlights:
- Current state: initial `node:test` harness in `tests/` covering blog URL helpers, database conversion routines, and selected GET handlers via stubbed `daveappserver` callbacks (`npm test`).
- New tooling: `scripts/smoke.sh` for manual curl-based smoke checks, `scripts/bench-getriver.js` for ad-hoc latency measurements, `scripts/setup.js` for interactive/CLI config generation (with optional local MySQL provisioning), and `notes/codeReviews/perfBaselines.md` to log future results.
- Next coverage goals:
  - **Unit tests**: extend beyond conversion helpers to subscription logic, likes toggles, and Markdown handling using fixtures.
  - **Integration tests**: deepen beyond stubbed GET handlers to include authenticated flows once session strategy is finalized.
  - **Smoke / E2E scripts**: integrate the new smoke and bench commands into the release checklist after they’re exercised on staging.
  - **Performance regression checks**: capture benchmark results in `perfBaselines.md` once representative data is available.
- Tooling considerations: continue relying on `node:test` + `node:assert` to avoid third-party dependencies; use helper stubs to prevent outbound calls.
- Process alignment: fold the suite into the release checklist and plan a CI job once coverage broadens.

Milestones:
1. Define test environment setup (mock config, local MySQL schema) and commit fixtures. **(in progress: stubbed config in place; DB fixtures outstanding)**
2. Implement foundational unit tests for `database.saveItem`, `database.subscribeToFeed`, and `blog` formatting helpers.
3. Expand HTTP integration suite (e.g., `/subscribe`, `/setsubscriptioncategories`, `/getreadinglistsubscriptions`) with authenticated scenarios.
4. Script smoke tests (curl wrappers) mirroring manual checks; document in `notes/_TEMPLATE.md` for reproducibility. **(smoke script created; pending validation against staging)**
5. Integrate tests into CI and document run commands in README / worknotes.
6. Establish performance regression script leveraging existing load-test tools; tie into review plan. **(bench script scaffolded; baseline collection pending)**

Follow-up:
- [x] Draft fixtures/harness approach (`node:test`, module stubs). (Owner JES)
- [x] Automate unit + integration runs under `npm test`. (Owner JES)
- [ ] Publish smoke test scripts and update release checklist. (Owner JES)
- [ ] Capture performance regression baseline results and store under `notes/codeReviews/perfBaselines.md`. (Owner JES)
