# Notes Entry Template

Use this skeleton for any document in `notes/`, keeping conventions aligned with the rest of the project and pointing back to the relevant upstream (`scripting/feedland`) context.

```
#### MM/DD/YY; HH:MM:SS AM by <initials> -- <short title>

Context:
- Topic / subsystem: ...
- Related files or endpoints: ...

Highlights:
- Point: ...
- Observation: ...

Follow-up:
- [ ] Task description (owner if known)
```

- Timestamps: local time with seconds, matching `worknotes.md`.
- Attribution: replace `<initials>` with the note-taker (e.g., DW, JW).
- Prefer short, active summaries; keep bullet labels consistent for easy scanning.
